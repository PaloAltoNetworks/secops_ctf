## Initialize Terraform

- You should use v12 (not v11)
- Now do `cd aws` and type `terraform init` to get started.
- You should see a message as below

```
Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.
```
