# QUICKSTART

Do these steps to get your local machine ready. 

## Prepare your local environment.

- [Generate AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-configure.html)
- Place your AWS credentials in ~/.aws/credentials
  - For example:

```
[default]
aws_access_key_id=AXIAYZDDL9ZF3GPCGMEG
aws_secret_access_key=brFz5pGbHN6ei6UHy0y0dXg0hWD0TVzFiMMbtPe
```

- Create a file called /aws/terraform.tfvars
  - For example:

```
aws_access_key="AXIAYZDDL9ZF3GPCGMEG"
aws_secret_key="brFz5pGbHN6ei6UHy0y0dXg0hWD0TVzFiMMbtPe"
```

- Run the "config" script in this repo. 
- Correct the errors until you get output as below.

```

franklin@reticulum ~ ðŸ”¬  bash ./config.sh 

***** Do the Setup for Mac *****
/usr/local/bin/brew
Already up-to-date.
/usr/local/bin/terraform
Found terraform
/usr/local/bin/aws
***** Mac Setup Complete *****
***** Confirm AWS Configuration *****

aws-cli/2.0.5 Python/3.8.2 Darwin/18.7.0 botocore/2.0.0dev9
AWS Configuration looking good...
***** Check  for terraform.tfvars file *****

Found tfvars file in /Users/fdiaz/workspace/ctf_scoreboard/terraform/aws/terraform.tfvars


No errors. All clean and green.
```

## Subscribe to Firewall AMI

- [Navigate to this link](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp?sku=6njl1pau431dv1qxipg63mvah)
- Accept the terms
- Configuration:
  - Fullfillment option: 64-bit AMI
  - Software Version: PAN-OS 9.0.6 (Nov 30th, 2019)
  - Region: US West Oregon
  - Verify the Ami Id: ami-09caf56db45f96bca

## Key Management

- Use existing or [create an SSH key pair](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/ec2-ssh-key-pair-regions/)
  - Do not share the private half of your key, ever.
- [Add the public half of your SSH key to your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html#how-to-generate-your-own-key-and-import-it-to-aws).
  - Name it "scoreboard" to match the name Terraform is expecting.

## Initialize Terraform

- The `config.sh` script should have helpd you complete Terraform install by this point.
  - You should use version 0.12.x (not v11)
  - v0.12.x is not compatible with prisma scanners at this time.
- Do `cd aws` and then `terraform init` to get started.
- You should see a message as below

```
Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.
```

- Finally, you can run `terraform apply`.
- You will see two IP addresses for the firewall after completion.
- In your browser, navigate to https://x.x.x.x/, where x.x.x.x is the IPv4 value of "firewall_mgmt_public_ip".
- You can log in with the credentials specified in the bootstrap.xml file.

## Teardown

- use the command `terraform destroy` to tear everything down.
