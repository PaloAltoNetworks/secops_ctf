## Key Management

- Add the public half of your SSH key to your AWS account.
  - Name it "scoreboard" to match the name Terraform is expecting.

## Initialize Terraform

- The `config.sh` script should have helpd you complete Terraform install by this point.
  - You should use version 0.12.x (not v11)
  - v0.12.x is not compatible with prisma scanners at this time.
- Do `cd aws` and then `terraform init` to get started.
- You should see a message as below

```
Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.
```

- Finally, you can run `terraform apply`.
- You will see two IP addresses for the firewall after completion.
- In your browser, navigate to https://x.x.x.x/, where x.x.x.x is the IPv4 value of "firewall_mgmt_public_ip".
- You can log in with the credentials specified in the bootstrap.xml file.
