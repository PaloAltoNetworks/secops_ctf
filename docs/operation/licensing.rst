Firewall 
  The PA-300 FW has limited functionality without a license,
  but will still work well enough that folks can run the 
  Terraform successfully. This will cause some issues however.
  For example, no logs will be captured on the firewall.

Getting A License
  You can get a 10 device auth code at the 
  `System Engineer Devices`_. site.
